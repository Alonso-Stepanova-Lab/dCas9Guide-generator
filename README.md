# dCas9Guide-generator
This MatLab script can be used to generate the spacer sequences of a gRNA and synthetic promoter sequences with reduced homology with the spacer guide RNA. If more than one spacer guideRNA sequence is generated, the number of maximum number of consecutive matches in the guideRNA sequences can be set (from 4 to 8). No GG or CC sequences are allowed to prevent the formation of PAMs that could be used by the dCas9 to initiate sequence recognition. The GC content of any sequence (guideRNA or synthetic promoter can be also set.
